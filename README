1. Compile with agent.c with make.

2. Compile manager.java with javac. 

3. Execute agent.c with a server name argument.
   E.g. ./agent pyrite-n3

4. Execute manager.java with "java manager".

5. I have only completed BeaconSender and BeaconListener (only receiving and printing).

6. I did as much as I could since I am juggling 4 Computer Science courses so this really took me a while to complete
   (and I am also a slow learner).
